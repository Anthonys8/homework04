# Problem set 4

**Purpose: Practice multivariate regression and diagnostics**

## Directory structure

I have already set up the following directories:

- raw_data: original data files.
- code: data cleaning, variables, and analysis
- data: derived data files and results
- figures: generated figures and other figures for paper
- tables: generated tables

You may decide not to use all of these.

Some directories have a ReadMe file in them, but the
file contains just the name of the directory.
The reason is that this ensures that the directory
gets committed to GitHub.
